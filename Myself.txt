Hello Assalamualikum sir, mam

Thank you for giving me the apportunity to introduct myself.

My name is Abu Naiim. I am 23 years old and I am from Kenanigonj, Dhaka. I am studying bachelor of CSE in Daffodil University.

One area that truly captivates me is web development. I find joy in creating seamless and visually appealing websites. During my academic journey, I had the opportunity to delve deep into various web development technologies, honing my skills in HTML, CSS, CASS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Jquery, React.js, Ajax, PHP Laravel, Python Django, mysql and more.

I've had the chance to apply my knowledge through practical projects. For instance, I worked on Disease prediction System, Shop Management System, Online Shopping System, Agricultural Shop, Portfolio. Apart from this I have worked on some other applications. These experiences have not only strengthened my technical skills but also instilled in me the importance of collaboration and problem-solving.

My strength is hardworking positive attitude and honesty. My weakness is trusting easily everyone.

That's all about myself, thank you so much sir, mam
